Required software:
* NetBeans https://netbeans.org/downloads/8.2/
* Java https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

Instructions to use the run.bat(easier to use):
1. Go to into the folder EasyRunBat on GitHub.
2. Find run.bat, CSC499_HW1.jar, and the Sort Me.txt.
3. Download them all to the same location.
4. Makes sure they are all in the same file.

6. A window should pop up asking how you are wanting to sort the list from ascending word length order. If not, it will sort it by descending.
7. Type y for ascending or n for descending.
8. Then it will run the program the and the file called output.txt contains your sorted list.

Instructions to build and run:
1. Once the file is unzipped and “CSC499_HW1” in a location such as desktop.
2. Open NetBeans.
3. Click file on the top left.
4. Click open project.
5. Navigate to save location of “CSC499_HW1” folder. It should have a special icon over it.
6. Select “CSC499_HW1” folder and click “Open Project”.
7. On the left side there shall be a “CSC499_HW1” that you can double click or click the ”+” next to expand.
8. Then through the same method as above expand the “Source Packages”. 
9. Then through the same method as above expand the “csc499_hw1”.
10. Then double click the “CSC499_HW1.java”. This should bring up the code in a tab next to the “Start Page”.

Instructions to sort a different list:
1. Navigate to where the “CSC499_HW1” folder is stored (Where you unzipped it to).
2. Open the “CSC499_HW1” folder.
3. Open the “src” folder.
4. Place the file that has the names you want sorted. Make sure its name “Sort Me.txt”.
5. Click ok to replace file or remove the old “Sort Me.txt” and then do step 4 again.
6. You can now go to the instructions to build and run step 2 to run it of build and run or just start at step 1 of the run.bat. 

Instructions to run test:
1. Go to into the folder BatchTest on GitHub.
2. Find test.bat, expectedUp.txt, expectedDown.txt, CSC499_HW1.jar, and the Sort Me.txt.
3. Download them all to the same location.
4. Makes sure they are all in the same file.
5. Double click test.bat.
6. A window should pop up comparing the output.txt file the program created and the expected.txt for the expected outcome
7. If there are no differences it should say no differences or show you the differences.
